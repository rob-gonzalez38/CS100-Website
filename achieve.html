             <h2>United States Marine Corps - 2020</h2>
                <p>After high school, I chose to serve in the United States Marine Corps, where I learned discipline, perseverance, and the value of teamwork. 
                My time in the Marines challenged me to grow not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, teaching me how to adapt under pressure and push through obstacles. 
                The friendships I built and the lessons I learned continue to guide me in how I approach life, responsibility, and leadership.</p>
          </li>

             <h2>Builders FirstSource - 2024</h2>
              <p>After leaving the Marines, I transitioned into civilian life by working at Builders FirstSource. 
               In this role, I gained hands-on experience in the construction supply industry, where I learned the importance of attention to detail, safety, and hard work. It also gave me a chance to connect with different kinds of people and see how individual effort contributes to a much larger project. 
               This period of my life helped me stay grounded and prepared me for the next step in my journey.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
             <h2>Boise State University - 2025</h2>
               <p>Today, I am pursuing my education at Boise State University, where I am studying computer science. 
               Being a student has given me the chance to apply the discipline and work ethic I developed earlier in life toward academic goals and career preparation. 
                I see this chapter as an opportunity to grow my technical skills, explore new interests, and open doors for a future career in technology. 
                My past experiences give me motivation to keep pushing forward, no matter the challenges that come my way. </p>
