        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, my name is Rob, and I’m currently a student at Boise State University where I’m studying computer science.
        I enjoy learning new things and I constantly try to better myself through the pursuit of knowledge.
        Outside of academics I like working with my hands, I like to fix, upgrade, and build things.
        My perfect day would consist of spending time with friends and family (dog included), riding my motorcycle, then coming home to unwind via video games or tv.</p>
